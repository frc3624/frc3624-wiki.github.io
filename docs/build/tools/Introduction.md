## Introduction

At the core of the build room are the tools we use to create the different parts of the robot. Most of everything you need can either be located in one of our rolling drawer carts or one of our shelving units located on the right side of the room (from entry). Of course, you can also always ask any of your leaders on the team for the location of that specific tool you need, but getting acquainted with the room will sufficiently help the work you contribute to the robot..

On that note, it is important to understand the different options you have for any number of scenarios you will find yourself in while building, and further knowing exactly how to operate the tools for your safety, and more important, the robot’s safety. Just kidding. You know we roll Safety First! But seriously, the misuse of a tool could result in damaging the robot or specific parts that we need, always ask if you don’t know!
