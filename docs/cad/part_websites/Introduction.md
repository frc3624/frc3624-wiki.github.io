# Introduction

When we CAD using parts that we bought off the internet, we download CAD models provided by the manufacturer's websited. Below is a list of websites where we download CAD files from.

Before you download, make sure the part isn't in _General Robot Parts_ first.

The parts will not always be found on these above websites, but you could probably find the files if you search the part name(s) on Google.
